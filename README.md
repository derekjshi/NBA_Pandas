Thanks for visiting this repository,

This is a basic experiment to begin experimenting and familiarizing myself with Jupyter Notebooks, Pandas, and Matplotlib

As I have a passion for sports, and quite enjoy playing and watching basketball I figured what better data set than all NBA players and their statlines each of the seaosons from
1996 - 2020. 

Some of the challenges faced with this dataset include the duplication of individuals as they may have played in multiple seasons, inclusion of some individuals that were
drafted before the first season on record 1996 - 1997, and even the fact that the 2019 - 2020 season is not officially over. 

In an attempt to familiarize myself, I wanted to practice isolating specific lines of data, through a method in numpy known as boolean indexing. I attempted to isolate the top 3
draft picks of each year since 1996, and specifically isolate their rookie seasons. I plotted the average PPG, RPG, and APG for the top 3 draft picks since 1996 to visualize and
attempt to see any form of pattern emerge. While the number of data values within this investigation were quite low, in the plot of average PPG a small pattern seemed to emerge 
along the lines of an x^2 (or maybe a sin) function. 

In a further attempt to practice and experiment, I'll be evaluating the average stat lines for each draft class to determine if that might be more suitable to fit a line of 
best fit to in order to estimate and predict the next draft classes' average stat line. 

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Feel free to drop a suggestion in the comments with any critiques or suggestions for further evaluation. 

Thanks!
